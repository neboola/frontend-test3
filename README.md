Welcome to the second test, may the pug be with you üëãüèº

![pug](https://picsum.photos/id/1025/300/300)

This time you will have to code the following screen, only for mobile devices:

https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main/#/console/18958536/395028718/inspect

Use the following credentials if needed:
- email: miguel+testfront@neboola.studio
- password: Testfront

Using the preview mode you can check how the screen should look and using the inspect mode you'll be able to find about the implementation details (margins, font sizes, etc).

The idea is to load a random set of 10 images using a fanstastic free-to-use API called Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/

1. Read the docs and discover Lorem Picsum's API.
2. Connect the API to your frontend code.
  - Use the list endpoint to get a list of 10 elements using a random name page from 10 to 30 (both included).
  - Show those images in the list and display the author's name on the card as showed in the design.

Feel free to use any client side JS framework/library but we recommend you to use React.

Focus on **performance** and **readability**. Consider any corner cases.

Write down any assumption you make.

You can share your code with us using a github repository or a google drive link. You can even deploy they project using something like github pages if you want.

Happy coding ü§ì
